    \section{Project Summary}
    Write a program that prints out increasing prime numbers, approximately one every second. The program will receive
    signals from the operating system that will require actions to be taken within the application.

    \section{Challenges}
    Working across multiple threads that had their own threads was a new challenge for sure. I learned quite a bit about
    to manage synchronization between threads, and polling. Without the instructors assistance this would have been a much more difficult task.
    I am glad to have had the exposure as I am sure tese topics will come up again.

    \section{Successes}
    Ultimately, the program was able to run as expected. With much trial and error, we were able to produce a working
    product that met most of the requirements. We also did well with team members dealing with other issues mid project
    and we were able to adjust accordingly.

    \section{Lessons Learned}
    Again, design was a big part of this project. We had to make sure that we were able to handle all of the edge cases.
    If I could start over, I would have spent more time on the design and less time on the implementation. Specifically,
    I would have tried to tie the destruction of a given thread to the destruction of the thread that spawned it. This would
    have made the code much more readable and easier to understand, while being much more manageable.
