  \section*{Description}
A pair of programs, a dispatcher and a listener, will act as a communication relay.
  The program dispatcher passively accepts text from standard input, exiting normally on EOF.
  The program listener will print out any text that was sent to a running instance of dispatcher. When
  dispatcher exits, so too does listener.

  \section*{Automated Test Cases}
  Automated  tests  may  be  executed  with  make check.  This  will  both  build  the  tests  and  run  them.  These
are all unit tests of functions.

  \section*{Common Test Cases}
  Prerequisites: relay directory does not already exist
  \subsection*{TC1: Installation}
  1. git clone git@git.umbc.tc:tdqc/tdqc12/rsoto/relay.git\\
  2. cd relay\\
	Expected: relay directory is created\\
  \\Prerequisites: In the projects directory
  \subsection*{TC2: Correct branch}
  1. git branch\\
Expected: main is default branch\\
  \subsection*{TC3: Build Cleaning}
  1. make\\
2. make clean\\
3. ls *.o\\
Expected: No such file or directory error\\
  \\Prerequisites: relay directory does not already exist
  \section*{"Project" Test Cases}
  Prerequisites: In the projects directory; make clean
  \subsection*{TC4: Build Explicit}
1. make dispatcher OR make listener\\
2. ls dispatcher OR ls listener\\
Expected: file is listed\\

\subsection*{TC5: Build Implicit}
1. make\\
2. ls dispatcher\\
3. ls listener\\
Expected: file is listed\\
\subsection*{TC6: Build Debugging}
1. make debug\\
2. readelf --debug-dump=decodedline dispatcher\\
3. readelf --debug-dump=decodedline listener
Expected: debugging info is listed\\
\subsection*{TC7: Build Cleaning}
1. make\\
2. make clean\\
3. ls dispatcher\\
4. ls listener
Expected: No such file or directory error\\
\\
Prerequisites: In the project's directory; make\\
\subsection*{TC8: No command line arguments}
1. ./dispatcher\\
2. echo \$?\\
3. ./listener\\
4. echo \$?\\
Expected: program exits with proper output \\
\subsection*{TC9: with command line arguments}
1. ./dispatcher arguments\\
2. echo \$?\\
Expected: program exits with usage error\\
\subsection*{TC10: with l flag set}
1. ./dispatcher -l num\\
2. echo \$?\\
Expected: program exits with proper output and sets the limit for connections\\
\subsection*{TC11: with b flag set}
1. ./dispatcher -b\\
2. echo \$?\\
Expected: Program reads from stdin without buffering by line\\
